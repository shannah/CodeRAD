== Introduction

=== What is Codename One?

https://www.codenameone.com[Codename One] is a toolkit for Java and Kotlin developers who want to build native apps for both iOS and Android, but don't want to have to maintain two separate codebases. It provides a cross-platform SDK for developing native mobile apps using a single codebase with 100% code reuse between iOS and Android.

Unlike Flutter, which uses Dart as programming language,
Codename One apps are written in Java or Kotlin, giving you access to its well established and mature eco-system.

=== What is CodeRAD?

CodeRAD is a library for Codename One that facilitates rapid development of Codename One apps using established design patterns such as dependency injection and MVC (model-view-controller) .  It includes foundation classes for developing models, views, and controllers, which dramatically increases code re-use and reduces application complexity.  It also provides an XML-based declarative language for building views.

[NOTE]
====
.From Wikipedia:
Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. This kind of pattern is used for designing the layout of the page.

=== Goals of CodeRAD

CodeRAD aims to increase developer productivity in building mobile applications by:

. *Employing MVC (Model-View-Controller) principles* for structuring applications, leading to cleaner code that is easier to maintain.
. *Providing reusable, high-level UI components* that can be easily integrated into applications without having to do any UI design.
. *Providing Extensible Application Templates* that can be used as a starting point for building complete applications.

Another way of stating this is to say that CodeRAD aims provide second, and third order components to mobile app developers, as described in the following sections.

==== First-Order UI Components vs Second-Order UI Components

A first-order UI component is a basic UI component, like a label, button, or text field, that is completely application-agnostic.  These form the fundamental building blocks of a GUI application, they need to be stitched together by the developer to form a coherent user interface for the user.

A second-order UI component is a complex UI component, usually composed of multiple basic components, which is designed for a specific type of application.  Some examples of second-order UI components are login forms, contacts lists, chat room components, news lists, etc..

First-order components are easier to develop and reuse because they don't rely on any particular "model" or application type.  But having to reinvent the wheel every time you need a common type of second-order component (e.g. a login form) can be tedious and time-consuming.

Second-order components, being more complex, are harder to develop, and even harder to re-use.  Most second-order components are so application-specific that they are of no use to any app other than the one it was originally built for.

The Codename One core library includes a comprehensive set of first-order components, but very few second-order components, because of the reusability issues. There are lots of tutorials on how to build your own second-order components using the core components as building blocks, but even this can be time-consuming.

CodeRAD aims to improve the situation by providing a foundation for second-order UI components such as chat rooms, login forms, settings forms, and contact lists.  The key innovation that makes this possible is its use of "loose-coupling" to allow for greater degree of reusability and customization.  The goal is to develop UI kits for as many genres of applications as possible.  The first proof-of-concept component was the https://github.com/shannah/RADChatRoom[ChatRoomView], which provides a fully-functional UI chat room component.  The second project is the https://github.com/shannah/TweetAppUIKit[Tweet App UI Kit] which provides high-quality UI components for building apps like Twitter.

==== Third-Order UI Components: App-in-a-Box

A third-order component is a reusable UI component that provides full-application functionality out of the box.  The same principles used by CodeRAD to build second-order components could theoretically be used to produce fully-functional, yet reusable and customizable applications as turn-key components.  This is beyond the initial scope of CodeRAD's aims, but after we've tamed enough of the second-order frontier, we may broaden our horizons and begin targetting entirely reusable apps.  Stay tuned...



=== Fundamental Concepts

There are just a few fundamental concepts required to start using CodeRAD to accelerate your development.

. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[MVC (Model-View-Controller)] - A design pattern employed by CodeRAD which is used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements
+
image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/MVC-Process.svg/200px-MVC-Process.svg.png[]
. *Entities* - CodeRAD introduces `RADEntity`, a base class for "model" classes.  This includes all the required plumbing for developing reusable components, such as property binding, property change events, data conversion, property lookup, etc...
. *Tags* - Tags enable loose-coupling of components.  Properties may contain one or more "tags" which can be used as a more generic way to reference properties on an entity.
. *Views* - A View is a user interface component that renders a model in a specific way.
. *Controllers* - Controllers define the structure and flow of an application.  All user interaction is handled by the controller.  Your application's main class will be an instance of `ApplicationController`.  Each form can have an associated `FormController`.  In some cases you may associate a `ViewController` with other UI components also.
. *Actions* - Actions provide a means of extending the functionality of a view.  Each view will publish a list of action categories that it supports.  The controller may then register actions in these categories to embed buttons, menus, and functionality into the view.

=== Entities, Properties, Schemas and Tags

The **Entity** sits at the core of CodeRAD.  The https://shannah.github.io/CodeRAD/javadoc/com/codename1/rad/models/Entity.html[Entity] class is the base class of all model classes in CodeRAD.  Each https://shannah.github.io/CodeRAD/javadoc/com/codename1/rad/models/Entity.html[Entity] has an https://shannah.github.io/CodeRAD/javadoc/com/codename1/rad/models/EntityType.html[EntityType] which defines the properties that are available in an entity.  Properties, in turn, may be "tagged" with zero or more https://shannah.github.io/CodeRAD/javadoc/com/codename1/rad/models/Tag.html[Tag]s.  These tags can be used to lookup properties on an entity in a more generic way than referring to the property itself.  

We provide a set of existing tags in the https://shannah.github.io/CodeRAD/javadoc/com/codename1/rad/schemas/package-frame.html[schemas] package that can be used as a common foundation by both models and views.  These tags were adapted from the schema definitions at https://schema.org.

[INFO]
====
https://schema.org provides a large set of schemas for common data types that one might need in an application.  It provides a base schema, https://schema.org/Thing[Thing] that includes properties that may be common to any type of "thing", such as `name`, `description`, `identifier`, `image` etc..  This schema has been ported into Java as the https://shannah.github.io/CodeRAD/javadoc/com/codename1/rad/schemas/Thing.html[Thing] interface.  

Each property has a corresponding https://shannah.github.io/CodeRAD/javadoc/com/codename1/rad/models/Tag.html[Tag] defined.
====

The concept of tags is a simple one, but they have powerful effect.  If a view needs to render its model's "phone number" (e.g. a contact list view), then it doesn't need to know anything about the properties in the model.  It is able to look up the phone number of the model by the `Person.telephone` tag:

[source.java]
----
String telephone = model.getText(Person.telephone);
----

As long as the model includes a property that is tagged with the `Person.telephone` tag, this will work.  If the model doesn't include this property, then this will simply return null.

The following diagram depicts how Tags can be used as a sort of "glue" layer between the View and the Model, and Action categories (discussed later under "Controllers") as a glue lasyer between the View and the Controller.  

.Tags are used to bind views to the appropriate properties of their view model using loose coupling.  Action categories are used to bind views to their controllers using loose coupling.

==== Example Entity Class

The following figure shows the definition of a very simple entity class:

[source,java]
----
import com.codename1.rad.schemas.Person;
import com.codename1.rad.models.Entity;

@RAD <1>
public interface UserProfile extends Entity <2> {
    @RAD(tag="Person.name") <3>
    public String getName();
    public void setName(String name);

    @RAD(tag="Person.description")
    public String getDescription();
    public void setDescription(String description);

}
----
<1> The `@RAD` annotation tells the CodeRAD annotation processor to generate a concrete implementation for this class, as well as a Wrapper class.
<2> We extend the `Entity` interface which all model classes must implement.
<3> The `@RAD(tag="Person.name")` annotation tells the CodeRAD annotation processor to bind the `getName()` method to the `Person.name` tag.  This means that `myProfile.getName()` would be the same as `myProfile.getText(Person.name)`, and `myProfile.setName(name)` is the same as `myProfile.setText(Person.name, name)`.

The CodeRAD annotation processor will generate two concrete implementations of our `UserProfile` interface during compilation:

. _UserProfileImpl_ : A default implementation of the UserProfile interface that you can use for instantiating the User profile.  E.g. When you want to create a new instance of `UserProfile`, you could call:
+
[source,java]
----
UserProfile myProfile = new UserProfileImpl();
----
. _UserProfileWrapper_ : A class that can "wrap" an entity of any type to allow the `UserProfile` interface to be used to interact with it.  This is handy for converting between different entity types that support the same tags.  It forms part of the basis for the loose-coupling feature that makes CodeRAD such a powerful toolkit.  This wrapper class includes a static `wrap()` method that takes an entity as a parameter, and returns either the same entity (if it already implements _UserProfile_), or wraps it with _UserProfileWrapper_ (if it doesn't implement _UserProfile_.).  You can think of this sort of like casting one Entity type to another Entity type. E.g.
+
[source,java]
----
Entity someEntity = ...;
UserProfile profile = UserProfileWrapper.wrap(someEntity);
String name = profile.getName();
    // This calls someEntity.getText(Person.name) internally
----

==== Accessing Property Values

You can access property values using the "getter" methods of your entity type.  E.g.

[source,java]
----
myProfile.getName(); // returns the profile name
----

Alternatively, you can access them using the tag that was assigned to the property.  e.g.

[source,java]
----
myProfile.getText(Person.name); // Returns the profile name
----

The two examples above are equivalent for our _UserProfile_ entity because we assigned the `Person.name` tag to the _name_ property of our entity.

TIP: Which method you use will depend on the context.  Use the first form if you are working with a _UserProfile_ object directly.  Use the 2nd form if you are working with an _Entity_ of unknown type and you want to retrieve or set its `Person.name` property.  This is especially handy for developing reusable UI components that expect models to include certain "tags".  For example, a "Contact Card" component probably expects a `Person.name`, `Person.email`, `Person.phone`, etc.. property, but it doesn't care exactly what type of model it is.  That way it will work with any Entity class that it is given.  All the Entity class needs to do is include properties corresponding to those tags.  It goes without saying that such a view would need to be able to handle the case where the entity doesn't inclode one or more of those tags.

=== Views

The "View" is the piece of the MVC pie that we are most interested in sharing and reusing.  A View is a https://www.codenameone.com/javadoc/com/codename1/ui/Component.html[Component] that includes support to "bind" to a view model (an https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.codenameone/coderad-common/latest/com/codename1/rad/models/Entity.html[Entity]), such that when properties on the view model are changed, the "View" updates to reflect the change.

The recommended way to develop views is using RADL, Code RAD's declarative markup language for creating visual components.  RADL files are converted to Java view classes at compile time by CodeRAD's annotation processor.

The following is a basic RADL file that simply displays "Hello World"

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<y>
    <label>Hello World</label>
</y>
----

NOTE: You can also create views directly using Java or Kotlin by extending either `AbstractEntityView` or `EntityListView`.  However, using RADL is much easier, and provides many other benefits, such as dependency injection to make like more enjoyable.

Views should be placed inside the _common_ module in the _src/main/rad/views_ directory, using Java package hierarchy conventions.  E.g. If want your view to compile to the class `com.example.MyView`, then you would create your view file at _src/main/rad/views/com/example/MyView.xml_.

A single RADL file will generate multiple Java classes.  For a given view file _MyView.xml_, it will generate the following classes:

. _MyView_ - The view class.
. _MyViewSchema_ - An interface with _Tag_, and _Category_ definitions that are declared in the view.
. _MyViewModel_ - An an _Entity_ interface representing the view model of for the view.
. _MyViewModelImpl_ - A default implementation of _MyViewModel_.
. _MyViewModelWrapper_ - Wrapper class for _MyViewModel_.
. _MyViewController_ - A default _FormController_ implementation for for using _MyView_.
. _IMyViewController_ - A marker interface that you can use to mark controllers as compatible with _MyViewController_.


=== Controllers and Actions

Controllers serve two functions in CodeRAD:

. *Separation of Concerns* - Controllers handle all of the "application logic" as it pertains to the user's interaction with the app.  Keeping application logic separate from the view and the model has many advantages, including, but not limited to, easier code reuse.
. *Application Structure & Control Flow* - Controllers provide hierarchical structure for applications similar to the way that Components provide hierarchical structure for user interfaces.  While it possible to use CodeRAD components in isolation, (without a controller hierarchy), you would be missing out on some of CodeRAD's best features.

==== The "Navigation Hierarchy"

It is useful to think of your app's controllers through the lens of a "navigation hierarchy".  The "root" node of this navigation hierarchy is the https://www.javadoc.io/static/com.codenameone/coderad-common/1.0.1/com/codename1/rad/controllers/ApplicationController.html[ApplicationController].  To show the first form in our app, we create a `FormController`, which can be views as a "Child controller" of the application controller.  If the user clicks a button that takes them to a new form, we create a new https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.codenameone/coderad-common/latest/com/codename1/rad/controllers/FormController.html[FormController], which is a child of the previous form controller.

CodeRAD's https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.codenameone/coderad-common/latest/com/codename1/rad/controllers/FormController.html[FormController] class includes built-in logic for "back" navigation.  If the https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.codenameone/coderad-common/latest/com/codename1/rad/controllers/FormController.html[FormController]'s parent controller is, itself, a https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.codenameone/coderad-common/latest/com/codename1/rad/controllers/FormController.html[FormController], then it will provide a "Back" button (and link up the Android "back" action) to return to the parent controller's form.

Typical code for creating a https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.codenameone/coderad-common/latest/com/codename1/rad/controllers/FormController.html[FormController] is:

.Typical code to create and show a https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.codenameone/coderad-common/latest/com/codename1/rad/controllers/FormController.html[FormController]. This code is assumed to be in another https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.codenameone/coderad-common/latest/com/codename1/rad/controllers/FormController.html[FormController], so `this` refers to the current controller, passing it as the first parameter sets it as the `detailsController`'s parent.
[source,java]
----
DetailsFormController detailsController = new DetailsFormController(this, model);
detailsController.show();
----


==== Event Propagation

The hierarchical view of controllers is also useful for understanding event dispatch.  When a https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.codenameone/coderad-common/latest/com/codename1/rad/controllers/ControllerEvent.html[ControllerEvent] is fired on a UI component, it will propagate up the UI hierarchy (i.e. https://www.codenameone.com/javadoc/com/codename1/ui/Component.html[Component] -> parent ..parent...) until it finds a component with a https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.codenameone/coderad-common/latest/com/codename1/rad/controllers/ViewController.html[ViewController].  The event will then be dispatched up the controller hierarchy until it is consumed.

For example, suppose, in our application, we have the following controller hierarchy:

. *Root Controller* - The https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.codenameone/coderad-common/latest/com/codename1/rad/controllers/ApplicationController.html[ApplicationController]
.. *ContactListController* - The main form of the app: A contact list.
... *ContactDetailsController* - The user clicked on a contact in the list, so they navigated to the "Details" form for that contact.  Thus the _ContactDetailsController_ is a "child" of the _ContactListController_.

The following diagram depicts this hierarchy.  Suppose that there is a button on the contact details form, that the user clicks to initiate an action event.  Then the event will propagate up the UI hierarchy until it finds a component with a ViewController.  In this case, the "Detail" form is the first component with a ViewController: The _ContactDetailsController_.   If the _ContactDetailsController_ contains a handler for the action that was fired, then it will process the event.  If the event is still not consumed, it will propagate up to the parent (the _ContactListController_), and give it an opportunity to handle the event.  If it is still not consumed, it will propagate up to the root controller (the _ApplicationController_).

.This image depicts the propagation of an action event up the UI hierarchy and then the controller hierarchy.
image:images/ControllerEventPropagation.png[]

The fact that action events propagate up through the controller hierarchy gives you flexibility on where you want to place your application logic for processing events.  This is very handy in cases where you want to handle the same action in two different controllers.  

For example, suppose you have a "phone" action that allows you to phone a contact.  The _ContactListController_ may support direct dialing of a contact in the list.  Additionally, you probably have a "Phone" button on the contact details form.  Since the _ContactDetailsController_ is a "child" controller of the `ContactListController`, you can handle the action once inside the _ContactListController_, rather than duplicating code on both the list and details controllers.
